                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the spring of my junior year, I took a numerical methods course. This class went through the basics
                            of using numerical methods to solve problems ranging from linear equations to nonlinear PDE's. We talked about many
                            concepts such as finite differencing, LU decomposition, finite elements, and Jacobian solvers. Each topic we discussed
                            was grouped into a project which we completed and wrote a report about. This page will look at each project,
                            discussing some of the basic elements involved. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Project 1: Finite Difference Heat Equation
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The first project we did involved solving the heat equation numerically. We discretized the heat equation on a cartesian grid
                            with finite difference methods. Since the Heat equation is linear, the system of equation we get is linear. This means 
                            we can represent it as an equation of the form <b>Ax=b</b>. A significant portion of the class was spent learning how to solve this
                            type of problem well. Almost every problem can be reduced to solving a linear system of equations many times over, so knowing
                            how to do this well was very important. For this class, we learned how to do Lower-Upper (LU) Decomposition. This splits our 
                            <b>A</b> matrix into a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix which multiply to give <b>A</b>. Since solving systems
                            with lower/upper triangular matrices is easy, we can take advantage of this to solve our system quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using MATLAB as our primary coding language, we implemented an LU solver that solved our finite difference equation to give us temperature values
                            on all our grid points. As can be seen below, we solved the heat equation in 1D and 2D. Our specific problem has assigned boundary conditions,
                            but had heat generation in the center. This gives us the parabolic profile we see in the 1D solution and the pseudo-parabolic profile we see in 2D.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although only the finest grids I solved are shown above, we also ran our solver on lower grid resolutions to witness the effect this has on
                            error and solve time. From our theory, we expected the error to have error roughly proportional to the grid size squared. 
                            This is to say, as we decrease the grid size we also expect our error to decrease. This is almost exactly what we see in Figure A3.

                                <img src = "/NumericalMethods/Assignment 1/ErrorFitGraph.png" class = "res" >

                            <figure style = "float:right; text-align:center">

                            </figure>
                            This graph shows the error against the number of grid points. The number of grid points is inversely related to the grid size,
                            which is why we have a negative slope here. This negative slope tells us that, as we increase the number of points in the grid, we get
                            a lower error. This is exaclty what we expected. In addition, since we have a slope of roughly -2, this shows that our quadratic error theory
                            does hold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A significant focus of this class was to match theory to practice. Although knowing the details can be important, this will only
                            be in the cases where one is attempting to apply the theory. Understanding the underlying ideas allows one to know the limitations
                            and problems with different methods. For example, we did not just focus on the error for the sake of matching error. We also looked at 
                            the error as a function of how much heat generation we had.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As can be seen in Figure A4, higher amounts of heat generation lead to significantly higher errors. Although this is a specific usage,
                            the idea that changes in specific parameters leading to changes in errors is common in many applications. For example, the Reynolds Number 
                            generally plays a similar role in CFD simulations and the Biot number can play similar roles in some Heat Transfer applications. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond solving the problem and keeping the error in mind, time was heavily emphasized. Numerical methods are only useful if they can 
                            be solved within a reasonable time frame. Although you can always throw bigger computers at problems, this comes with cost restrictions that
                            could make experiment cheaper or more time efficient. Keeping time constraints and efficiency in mind is very important in simulation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this problem, we looked at the efficiency of our LU solver. This was the rate limiting step as solving matrix equations become very
                            difficult very quickly. In general, solving matrix systems grow in time proportional to the size of the matrix cubed. For these large matrices 
                            this can lead to significant time commitments. 
                        </p>

                            When using mathlab, one generally has two options as to which solvers to use: one built into MATLAB or one that you right. For this project we 
                            compared the speed of both options and how they scale with the size of the problem. As can be seen in Figure A5, our solver is very close 
                            to the cubic trend we expect. The slowing factors that increase our time could be a result of things like storing variables, memory management, 
                            or a combination of many other things. However, the MATLAB solver is significantly faster. Being below a quadratic trend saves significant amounts of 
                            time when it comes to larger systems. As such, this exmaple showed the power of using libraries that have already been optimized and iterated on.

                            This class put a heavy emphasis on reports, allowing me to build good report habits.

                        <h2>Project 2: Non-Linear Equations and Continuation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although Linear problems are everywhere in the world, there are more non-linear problems. From material properties to fluid dynamics to heat transfer,
                            non-linearity is unavoidable in any real engineering application. This project taught us to deal with these types of problems.
                            The approach we took is equivalent to Newton's Method from calculus but expanded into multiple dimensions. This makes the derivative into a jacobian matrix 
                            which must be inverted to solve the problem. By doing this, we reduce our nonlinear system into a linear system. However, instead of instantly being able to solve
                            we need to iterate to reduce our error to acceptable levels.

                            As can be seen above, solving our non-linear wave equation can give us some very interesting graphs.
                            In the ones shown, we can already see two different modes forming. A two peak solution and a one peak solution. 
                            With some adjustment to the initial predictions we take, we can actually get any number of peaks along the x direction 
                            and y direction as we want. We could have 3 peaks along the X but 2 along the Y. Any combination is possible, and this is a result
                            of the nature of this problem.

                        <p>
                            In most problems which we need to solve iteratively, an intiial guess is required. For this problem, the initial guess 
                            would determine what solution "branch" we are on. As can be seen in Figure B4, there exist indepenent solution branches
                            that never intersect, expect when the norm is zero. Finding initial guesses for an arbitrary point on this graph is difficult.
                            However, this specific problem had easy initial guesses when the norm was close to zero. As such, we would solve the problem close to, but not
                            exactly at zero. We would then use a continuation method known as arc-length continuation to follow these branches to find new solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arc length continuation allows us to walk a specific "length" along these curves shown. For example, let us say we begin on the dotted line near 
                            the intersection with zero. We could then follow the curve on the upper or lower track to any specific solution we want. Initially we were taught 
                            analytic continuation, which could reach any point on <i>either</i> the top or bottom curve given we start on the same side. The benefit of 
                            arc length continuation is that it does not have this limitation and can explore either section freely given enough time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project showed the art that is finding a starting problem. Discovering that the near-zero solutoins were easy to find was not a feature of every
                            equation. It is a feature specific to the problem we had. Each problem has its own unique initial problem which needs to be approached with creativitiy.
                            In addition, continuation methods can be used to expand our solution landscape without having to shoot in the dark with initial conditions.

                        <h2>Project 3: Time Integration</h2>
                        <p>
                            So far, we have only looked at steady state problems. However, many problems fall into the class of initial value problems.
                            For example, consider solving kinematic problems or other time dependent problems. In these cases, we use a similar but
                            different set of methods to find solutions. These all stem from the same finite difference methods, but applied to the time derivative.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this project, we looked at the Lotka-Volterra system. This models the population of a predator-prey system. We implemented simple time
                            integration schemes to see how the populations evolved and used various initial conditions to visualize the solution. All of these systems are periodic.
                            This can be seen in Figures C1 and C2 below. This means that visualizing the system only requires so much time to be resolved. However,
                            finding a time scale that is good for visualizing this system can be difficult, especially when comparing different populations.

                            To fix this visualization problem, this project introduced us to phase diagrams. Instead of plotting population with respect to time,
                            we plot the two populations against one another. If we do not care about the time it takes for populations to change but instead
                            only worry about the population values, a phase diagram is a good visualization.

                            In addition to allowing us to see how the population evolves, phase diagrams give us great information on system behavior also.
                            Each curve represents a different system. Each system has its own maximum and minimum population along with its own behavior. This graph 
                            visualizes this well as there are no two intersecting curves, even if they get close. In addition, since each curve is a closed loop, we know that the
                            system is periodic. This also allows us to easily see the steady state points, which in this case lies at (1,1). This is the point all the curves 
                            "rotate about". This point, in rotating about itself, stays in the same position. Phase diagrams are a powerful visualization tool for many types of problems.

                            Being able to visualize steady points was important for this assignment as it also taught us the power of stability analysis in numerical applications.
                            This project differentiated physical stability from numerical stability. Physical stability is a property of the physics we are trying to analyze.
                            For example, imagine a unrestrained population growth. We know this system would be unstable as it can be modeled by an exponential which grows to infinity over time.
                            For numerical applications, we generally look at physically stable systems. This can be thought of as things like a pendulum. A pendulum has a steady point at the bottom,
                            which numerical methods can capture. However, if we treat our problem poorly we cannot establish numerical stability. For example, if the time steps for a pendulum simulation become 
                            too large, the simulation could predict infinite rotations. This is known as divergence, and is not wanted. It leads to nonsense results. Understanding stability
                            is important for this homework as we needed to ensure small enough time steps to maintain stability. Stability is also tied to the difference between implicit and explicit methods,

                        <p>
                            With the semester coming to a close, we were assigned one quick final project. This was to go back to the heat equation from Project 1 and, instead 
                            of using finite difference methods, use finite element methods to solve the problem. Finite Element Methods are a popular method due to their robustness. 
                            Finite Elements can be used to solve many types of problems from fluid mechanics to structural dynamics to heat transfer with a simple application. In addition,
                            it is easily adapted to complex geometries that require unstructured meshes, something finite differences cannot do reasonably.

                            Above, you can see some solutions we got in solving the 1D heat equation. From the first project, we can recall we expect a parabolic profile
                            for this problem. When we have less elements such as in Figure D1, we can see the influence of discretization. However, 
                            as we add more elements we get closer to the theory curve until it is almost indistiguinable. This helped emphasize the importance of a 
                            good mesh in engineering applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, by looking at Figure D2, we can see that with more elements, we can get good approximations of many different conditions.
                            Solving anything numerically is a balance of time and accuracy. A finer mesh gives you better results, but takes longer to run. For the scope of 
                            our simple heat transfer problem, we did not have to think about the mesh very much. The mesh will not be negligible in more complex engineering 
                            applications however. This experience helped teach why certain meshes, such as those with high aspect ratios are highly skewed elements, are bad 
                            for finite element methods and to avoid them when possible.
