                        <h1>Internship at Naval Surface Warfare Center - Philadelphia (WIP)</h1>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Over the Summer of 2023, I worked as a test engineering intern at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Philadelphia (NSWC-PD).
                            Here, I helped primarily with acoustics testing in water. This involved not only running the tests, but also calibrating sensors,
                            helping install censors and test components, and helping set up flow conditions. My summer project was to speed up the process
                            of setting up the flow tanks to achieve specific flow rates. This was done by developing a model in MATLAB that could predict
                            the maximum flow rate to within 99% accuracy. I presented my project at the Intern Poster Competition and placed Second place out
                            of approximately 30 other posters.

                        <h2>Details</h2>
                        <p>
                            In this position, I was working with the acoustics team to run tests on various components to determine if they were
                            within the standards necessary to deploy them onto Navy ships and submarines. I spent time calibrating accelerometers (accels) and hydrophones
                            to run tests with this purpose using Modal Shop programs and tooling. I kept documentation for each calibrated accel in the form of a 
                            calibration sheet (cal sheet) which gave information such as sensitivities, tolerances, calibration dates, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond calibration and helping with testing, I also worked on my own project for the Poster Competition.
                            My project was the figure out a model that could accurately predict the flow between two closed tanks with known initial
                            conditions. This meant that we not only had the water level changing with time, but the pressure in each tank would change 
                            as the water level changed. By first developing a differential equation which I then solved in MATLAB,
                            I was able to predict the flow rates to 99% accuracy. This was achieved after some minor adjustments and training was done 
                            to the model after my poster was created and presented.

                            To the right, you can see the poster I presented to win second place. My idea when creating the poster was
                            to provide the full story of the project I worked on. This started with an understanding of our current setup 
                            and capabilities along with its limitations. Then, I explained the benefits of a two tank setup and then started to slowly
                            become more technical, giving the problem setup and the equations I used along with the results and some comparisons.
                            Finally, I gave some limitations and future improvements for my model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As with most projects, I could not take the results to a state that I could call perfect. There are still many steps that
                            I could see that would improve the model. Currently, each time we swap out a test component, at least one test needs to be completed
                            to get data to fit my model to the new setup. This does have some time cost, and as such is not perfectly ideal.
                            Towards the end of my internship, I was working on ways to make the model completely predictive and not use any information
                            from a test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the theory was there, I also wanted to ensure that my program was usable. Although MATLAB is fairly common, it is known by everyone.
                            As such, I developed an app that implemented all the functionality of fitting to data, predicting flow rates, and generating the necessary 
                            initial conditions to achieve specific flow rates. This made my project very easy to use for many different test setups.
