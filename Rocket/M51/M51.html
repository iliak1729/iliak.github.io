                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since my Sophomore year, I have been working with M51 Space, an aerospace non-profit startup, to help build and test various 
                            rocketry related projects. These ranged from model rocket builds, to designing and testing a hybrid rocket engine, to building
                            a full rocket based around a commercial solid rocket engine which we flew at the Friends of Amateur Rocketry (FAR) competition.
                            All the work I did here was done with the amazing team at M51. You can find more information about all the projects we have worked on
                            at the <a href = "https://m51space.com/about" target ="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M51 Space Website</a>. I could 
                            not have gained the amazing experience I had without them.

                        <h2>Projects</h2>
                        <h3>Hybrid Rocket</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first project I worked on was building a Hybrid rocket. I was primarily in charge of working on the fluid systems for 
                            this engine. I took information from the propulsion team in regards to how much oxidizer flow they required and planned
                            the necessary piping and oxidier supply we needed. In addition to requiring the simple math to see how much oxidizer volume was necessary,
                            an important consideration in this project was safety.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our oxidizer for this project was Nitrous Oxide. It is important when working with chemical to take every step to ensure safety, especially in 
                            rocketry where a mistake can lead to explosions. As such, some things that I had to look at was regulations on how much nitrous can be in a given 
                            sized tank. Due to the supercritical nature of nitrous at room temperature, it is important to leave enough space for nitrous gas to keep stability.
                            This was done by looking at filling ratio standards used in various conditions such as in door storage, vehicle storage, and rocketry uses to ensure
                            we bought a big enough tank to be safe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I worked to plan the piping to ensure safety. This involved finding piping that was rated to the pressures that we were expecting.
                            Beyond this, I also added a valve system to ensure that we could start the test, stop in case of an emergency, and vent all the piping without going through 
                            the engine all from a safe distance. This was done in conjunction with the electrical team who helped incorporate these additions to our test control center.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was a great experience for me to over a summer. I gained a lot of insight into the full engineering design process. From the theory to 
                            planning out the manufacturing and making drawings to the testing procedure, I saw this project from start to end with the M51 team. What stood out
                            to me the most was the testing, which taught me that something unexpected will always happen and to plan for much more safety than you consider necessary 
                            when working with something even slightly as dangerous as a rocket.

                        <p>
                            The other project I worked on was the competition rocket we named Star Queen. This project took the entire duration of my junior year.
                            For this project, I served as the mechanical lead for M51, providing assistance and helping plan deadlines for each of the many subteams.
                            In addition, I personally worked on the aerodynamics of the rocket, in terms of the placement of different subsystems to adjust the center 
                            of gravity to maintain stability, and the manufacturing of all in house parts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My first individual responsibility was the aerodynamic stability of the rocket. This meant taking the designs for all subsystems we had
                            and integrating them into the rocket in such a way that they all functioned as necessary and we maintained as large of a stability margin for the
                            rocket as possible. When launching a rocket, unpredictable factors like wind can cause a change in trajectory. The more stability we have, the easier it is 
                            for the rocket to get back on track. The positioning of mass is important, but rockets of our scale also have fins to aid in the stability. They provide
                            surfaces that air can use to generate lift and drag to stabilize the rocket. Sizing fins is a balancing act. Larger fins provide for stability for the rocket,
                            but are prone to failing at much lower velocities. Finding a balance between thickness, height, and material to find cheap but effective fin designs was 
                            a good task. In addition, this allowed me to work with all subteams to understand their systems and ensure they are positioned such that everthing is functional
                            while maximizing stability.

                        <p>
                            The second project I worked on was the manufacturing. Beyond being the mechanical lead, I was one of only five people who had access to the machines
                            needed to manufacture the metal components we wanted to include in our rocket. As such, I worked with this subset of people to plan out manufacturing plans
                            and timelines to make sure everything was manufactured. I was primarily in charge of making the manufacturing plans and fixtures. This often required me to 
                            talk to the professional machinists we have at UPenn to come up with robust but simple plans, making the necessary fixtures for everyone to use, and doing 
                            at least one test run to ensure the plan worked and I could help explain any tricky parts of the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the picture to the left, you can see me with the fixture and the squared up material that was going to become centering rings, 
                            a set of components that are meant to hold the rocket motor in place and centered. In my right hand is the fixture. Since the centering 
                            rings require a decent level of precision to keep the motor in place, making a fixture to make sure all of them come out the same and 
                            are easy to machine was vital. Beyond the centering rings, I helped with the manufacturing plans and tolerancing of parts in our airbrake, 
                            recovery system, and fins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Mechanical lead, I also had the responsibility of ensuring all other subteams were on track to finish their components 
                            by our launch date in addition to my work. I met with teams periodically to do checkins where we would often do small scale
                            design reviews or work through problems they had. For example, I helped the airbrake team with the aerodynamic analysis of their fin
                            to help inform the model used in the control algorithm. I helped the rovery team with the analysis of their shock chord to ensure it was
                            strong enough to safely lower our rocket. I helped our rover team design the deployment system which allowed the rover to exit the rocket
                            upon landing. Most importantly, I served as a liaison between the mechanical and electrical teams, ensuring that all parts would interface well
                            and communicating mechanical requirements to electrical engineers and vice versa. This experience gave me good experience communicating with 
                            many different types of engineers, some of whom were working on projects I knew little about. This allowed me to learn how to have effective discussions
                            and set reasonable goals even in cases where I am not the expert.

                            We completed our rocket for FAR competition this past summer, where we flew to over 10k feet. This was an amazing accomplishment for a
                            team that has only been around for about two years. I am excited to see what work we do in the coming years.
