                        <h1>Aerodynamics</h1>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            During my Junior year, I took a Graduate Aerodynamics Course. This course covered the basics
                            of Aerodynamics and the analysis of airfoils and wings. By virtue of the professor, this class was
                            heavily project based and required significant use of computational resources to solve problems posed in the class.
                            Over the course of the class, we did three major projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The First project we worked on was related to Joukowski airfoils. A very old construct, the Joukowski airfoil takes advantage of
                            potential flow solutions to helpp find the pressure distribution on the surface of a special type of airfoil. This type of airfoil 
                            takes advantage of conformal mapping, a math trick, that allows us to map a circle to certain types of airfoils.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second project we worked on using vortex panel methods to find the lift characteristics of any geometry. Although in project 1
                            we could get similar information, we were limited in the geometries we could use. Panel methods get rid of geometry constraints and
                            allow us to find aerodynamic behavior of any geometry in potential flow. This involves splitting the the geometry into many small 
                            parts and solving flow equations for each part.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final project we did uses lifting line methods to account for the effect of downwash and tip vorices on wing aerodynamics. 
                            This allows us to take airfoil properties and expand them to any aspect ratio of wing we want. This method can even account for stall 
                            characteristics of wings given we have the airfoil data at these higher angles of attack.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Joukowski Airfoil</h2>
                        <p>
                            As we mentioned earlier, Joukowski airfoils make use of a math trick known as conformal mapping to give us airofil information. Below,
                            one can see what this would look like. The left graph is the original graph that we provide. This is simply flow around a disk. Given our
                            conformal mapping, we go to the right graph which is our airfoil. 
                        </p>
                        <figure style = "text-align:center">
                            <img src = "/Aerodynamics/Joukowski/TestFile_01.png" class = "res">
                            <figcaption style = "text-align:center">Figure 1. U Velocity Contour, 255x255 Grid, Re 1000</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            Given we have the full flow field information on the left, our mapping allows us to also know the full flow field information on the right.
                            Since we know things such as velocity, and we know the freestream pressure is ambient pressure, we can use Bernoulli's equation to find the pressure 
                            on all points of the airfoil. Pressure and lift are very closely connected, as lift is simply the integral of pressure over the entire airfoil surface. 
                            Of course, since we have a airfoil, which is 2D, we have a lift per unit length. However, this is what we expect for airfoils.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If one goes through and does the mapping for various different airfoil geometries, we can get pressure distributions (shown below). 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From this, we can see the effects of angle of attack (AOA) and camber on the pressure distribution of airfoils. To read these graphs,
                            the area between the blue line, which represents the lower surface, and the red line, which represents the upper surface, is a measure of the lift.
                            As long as blue remains above red, we are generating positive lift, which is good. This is the case for all our Joukowski airfoils.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some interesting things to note is that the effect of camber, although important, is not as major at higher angles of attack.
                            At these high angles of attack, we actually see that a majority of our pressure coefficients are negative, meaning our pressure
                            is lower than ambient. This is showing us that airfoils do not generate lift by pressure pushing up on the bottom surface.
                            Instead, they generate lift by being basically sucked up by the lower pressure enviornment on the top surface. This was 
                            one of the most memorable things I learned in this class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For each project, we also had to make a report and submit our code. The code for this project can be found <a href = "/Aerodynamics/Joukowski/JoukowskiCode.zip" download = "JoukowskiCode - Ilia Kheirkhah.zip">here</a>

                        <p>
                            Although this method gives us a lot of detail about our airfoils, we are limited to those which can be reached by conformal mapping. Not every 
                            airfoil can be reached through conformal mapping, so we need more tools to analyze a wider range of airfoils. This is where panel methods can help.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Vortex Panel Methods</h2>
                        <p>
                            The idea of Panel methods is to take your geometry and to split it into many little panels. For each panel, there is a set of
                            flow inducers (a vortex, in our case) and a collocation point. At the collocation point, our slip flow boundary condition is enforced.
                            The reason we do a slip boundary condition instead of a no slip boundary condition is that potential flow assumes an inviscid flow.
                            However, the no slip boundary condition requires a viscous fluid.
                        </p>

                        </figure>

                        <p style = "clear: both">
                            When doing this, the number of panels required to resolve your geometry is important. For our analysis, we looked a flat plate airfoil. 
                            As such, the effect of the number of panels was not too strong. However, figure 5 still shows us that it is not negligble, especially at 
                            smaller angles of attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, at larger angles of attack (Figure 6) we can see that the effect of the number of panels decrease.
                            On the other hand, we also see that the predicted lift curve deviates significantly from our theory curve as we get to
                            larger angles of attack. From our analysis of thin airfoils, we predicted that the lift curve slope will be 2*pi for all angles of attack. 
                            However, our analysis does not represent this. The reason for this is that the linear airfoil theory is only useful at low angles of attack.
                            From the graph, we can see that an angle of attack of 0.3 radians is fairly accurate to our theory. However, by running our analysis at larger
                            angles of attack results in us finding variation. In fact, it has been shown that the panel methods are more accurate than the thin airfoil 
                            theory in this case. This shows the power of panel methods in predicting the lift produced by bodies, even at relatively high angles of attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, one does need to be careful when using potentail flow methods at high angles of attack. Flow separation, which is an important 
                            feature to capture when trying to understand stall points for airfoils and wings, is not modeled in potential flow. In addition, viscous effects 
                            are also not captured. Some programs, such as XFOIL, have worked to account for these features for panel methods. However, the code I have made does
                            not use these advanced techniques. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once again, this project was made in MATLAB and placed into a report. The code can be found <a href = "/Aerodynamics/VortexPanels/VortexPanelCode.zip" download="Vortex Panels - Ilia Kheirkhah.zip">here</a>

                        </p>
                        <h2>Prandtl Lifting Line</h2>
                        <p>
                            Up to now, we have created tools to analyze airfoils, a 2D construct. However, we live in a 3D world and therefore
                            need tools to analyze such systems. Although panel methods can be expanded to three dimensions, they become difficult to manage.
                            Instead, we started to use Lifitng Line theory. This uses the relationship between airfoil lift and circulation to generate 
                            vortex strings known as lifting lines. This allows us to model the effect of tip vortices on the wing and generate more realistic
                            predcitions of lift on a wing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A major benefit of Lifting line methods is the fact that it can capture the preliminary effects of stall on a wing. To do this,
                            all that is necessary is the airfoil data which we provide for the wing cross-section has data that extends into the stall regime.
                            As long as we have airfoil lift coefficients in the stalled region, we can capture behavior of a wing in stall. This makes it 
                            slightly better than panel methods in some cases. With this same reasoning, lifting line methods can predict drag properties also.
                            This can be expanded to thrust and power requirements when a full vehicle analysis is conducted.
                        </p>
                        <figure style = "float:right">
                            <img src = "/Aerodynamics/LiftingLine/Wing Properties, No Prop.png" class = "res">
                            <figcaption style = "text-align:center">Figure 7. Lifting Line Predictions</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            A second major benefit of the Lifting Line method is that it can handle non-uniform velocity distributions on the wing. Although 
                            this is not common insteady level flight, it is still an important flight characteristic to consider. For example, turning maneuvers 
                            can result in different parts of the wing getting different freestream velocites. Another case is if there are propellers on the wing,
                            such as in electric vehicle applications. Many electric aircraft place their props on the wings, resulting in the section of wing
                            in the wake of the prop experiencing a different freestream velocity than the rest of the wing. Similar arguments can be used to
                            analyze rotorcraft wings, although not demonstarted here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Figure 7. shows the power of lifting line. This graph compares the airfoil lift and dra of a NACA0012 airfoil with a wing
                            of finite aspect ratio constructed of that airfoil. The thin airfoil approximation is shown for reference. It can be seen that
                            both drag and lift are lower in wings than in airfoils, at a given angle of attack. This is due to the downwash reducing our
                            effective angle of attack, leading to low lift and drag. However, this also means that the onset of stall is later, especially 
                            for very low aspect ratio wings. In certain designs, this can be used to our advantage to make the vehicle more maneuverable.
