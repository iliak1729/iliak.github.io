                            In the Fall of 2022, I took MEAM 201 - Machine Design and Manufacturing. This class taught us the basics 
                            of design and manufacturing. The goal of the entire course was to create our own heat engine. Some parts we were provided.
                            Othere we were provided drawings for. Some we designed ourselves from constraints given to us.
                            As can be seen in the video on the right, the end result is an engine that can run at
                            several hundred RPM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My experience in this course taught me many aspects of manufacturing a product. Over the semester, we learned how
                            to use many machines. Mills, Lathes, Bandsaws, and countless smaller tools for deburring, reference finding, or measuring.
                            This class taught me the complexity of manufacturing and the thought that needs to go into each part.
                            In addition, we learned about the details of tolerance, GD&T, and tolerance stacksup. We learned that these are a
                            vital component of desining in such a way that the assembly will work. Overall, this class was a great experience and I loved
                            having a finished project at the end.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Some Details</h2>
                        <p>
                            There were several parts that we had the freedom to design. The first was the bedplate, which is the largest part.
                            This part was sent out to be water-jet cut. As such, there were some limitations on internal corner dimensioning. 
                            In addition, since this part was to hold our entire assembly, there was a need for a pair of holes positioned a specific distance form each other. 
                            However, beyond these constraints, we had full creative freedom with the bedplate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src = "/Engine/Images/IsoPic.JPG" class = "res">

                            </figure>
                            Over the pandemic, I had the pleasure of enjoying Avatar: The Last Airbender again. I had not watched it in full
                            since I was young, but the story was as enjoyable as I remembered. As such, when I had to pick the design for my engine
                            I knew I would base it off of this show. My bedplate is a silhouette of the mainc character, as can be seen clearly in the picture below.
                            This was also the motivation of the flywheel that you can see spinning in the photos, which was inspired by a white lotus tile.

                            Finally, we had the freedom to design our balance weight. The purpose of this part was to shift the center of mass
                            of the subassembly that will be rotating to ensure that we do not have significant vibrations in our ideal design. Of course, 
                            machining tolerances and other factors lead to the actual result having some vibration, but the balance weight still helped to reduce
                            this off-center loading to a minimum. This was one of my favorite parts to design. Although it was less artistic than the bedplate, I felt
                            like I was applying some of my engineering knowledge to design this component. Understanding why we needed to shift the center of mass and
                            executing this in our design with the constraints of fitting into the larger assembly was very enjoyoable.
                        </p>

                            All in all, this class was one of my favorites and allowed me to create something that I could call my own. It also helped me learn about the 
                            complex world of manufacturing and gain an appreciatio for the work machinists do to create the parts engineers request.
