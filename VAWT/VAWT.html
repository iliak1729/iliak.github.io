                        <h1>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)</h1>
                        <h2> Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As a part of our Junior Lab course, we were asked to design and build a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT).
                            To do this, we began by doing research on the different types of VAWTS; Drag-Driven and Lift-Driven. Each
                            has their own benefits and restrictions. For example, Drag-Driven VAWTs are generally self starting, meaning they do not need to be initially moving to generate
                            power. They are also much easier to build. On the other hand, Lift-Driven VAWTs have a much higher efficiency but come with manufacturing difficulties as
                            airfoil geometry can be difficult to create, especially given our manufacturing processes (by hand).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Process and Results</h2>
                        <p>
                            To begin the design process, we started with brain storming several ideas. Drag based, Lift Based, Hybrid, and anything we could
                            think of. We settled on 3 major designs, one drag, one lift, and one hybrid. From here, we designed and 3D printed
                            scale models of these designs. This was used with our in house wind tunnel to do scale model testing. This allowed
                            us to apply concepts we had learned from dimensional analysis to anlayze wind turbines. We were told that Reynolds Number and
                            Tip Speed Ratio were two very important factors for efficiency, so we had to ensure that we kep this in mind when testing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Once we had the data, we analyzed it to see which design would have a good balance of manufacturability and power generation.
                            We settled on the drag based design, since it provided similar power output to the lift and hybrid designs while being much 
                            easier to manufacture. Once we settled on this design, we scaled it up while maintaining dimensional similarity. As can be 
                            seen below, we first made a laser cut skeleton to provide support to the sheets we would use to make the turbine surface. We
                            then worked together to apply adhesive evenly and careful to hold the sheets to the skeleton as smoothly as possible.

                        <p>
                            As can be seen from the completed turbine, the completed design was stable. We tested the VAWT by attaching it to a cart and
                            running with it in a sort of power competition. Our Turbine had the ability to generate just under 1 Watt of power when 
                            moving at about running speed. Although this was not enough to win the power competition, we were happy that it produced energy.

                            This project was one of my personal favorite labs as it gave us experience combining many facets of engineering. From
                            testing in the wind tunnel, to creating a model to see how much we had to scale up the turbine, to manufacturing, I felt like
                            everything had some thought spent on it. This type of engineering makes sure that I keep using knowledge that I otherwise might not
                            have the chance to use.
