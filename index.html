                        <p>
                            Hello! My name is Ilia Kheirkhah. 
                            I am currently an Undergraduate Student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Energy, Fluids, and Thermal Systems.
                            I am also an Accelerated Masters Student in Mechancial Engineering with a concentration in Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, and Energy Science.
                            I love everything Aerospace related, but have a particular passion for Rocket Propusion and Aerodynamics. 
                            As an engineer, I like to work on fluid systems using numerical methods. I have a strong background in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

                            This website was made for class for ENM 3440 - Answering Questions with Data, for Everyone<br>
                            In addition to making the website, I needed to complete a small data science project. This project, along with more information about this website, can be found <a href = "/ENM344/Homework 2/Homework2.html"> here</a>
