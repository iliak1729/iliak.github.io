                        <p>
                            Hello! My name is Ilia Kheirkhah. 
                            I am currently an Undergraduate Student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Energy, Fluids, and Thermal Systems.
                            I am also an Accelerated Masters Student in Mechancial Engineering with a concentration in Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, and Energy Science.
                            I love everything Aerospace related, but have a particular passion for Rocket Propusion and Aerodynamics. 
                            As an engineer, I like to work on fluid systems using numerical methods. I have a strong background in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Below are projects I am particularly proud of. Click on the pictures to be sent to the pages containing more information.
                            Although I am specifically proud of these projects, I believe all my projects give insight into my skills. You can find all 
                            my other in the projects tab in the top left.

                            In addition to the projects shown, this website is likely one of my favorite projects I have done. I coded 
                            all of this website using HTML and CSS over the course of approximately one month. This started as an assignment for a class 
                            (See <a href="/ENM344/Homework1/Homework1.html">ENM 3440 Assignment 1</a>) which required me to make one page to submit my assignment.
                            After learning HTML, I decided to expand this website to be my portfolio.
