                        <h2>Prompt 1 - Causal Questions</h2>
                        <p>
                            For this prompted, we asked ChatGPT to help us come up with a meaningful
                            causal question in a data set we provided. Once we had a good question, we
                            asked ChatGPT to analyze the data for us and give us the answer.
                            Although certain parts of the logic were sound, some parts 
                            were not the best. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 3 major decisions ChatGPT had to make were define as
                            Product Category Identification(PCI), Discount Identification(DI), and Effect on Quantity(EQ).
                            How chat approached EQ seemed straight forward, as it just looked at change in quantity sold.
                            There is no problem with this, and is likely how I would have approached this category.
                            How Chat approached PCI was also sound. Initially, it wanted to pick a specific product 
                            and see how discounts in that category influenced quantity. However, we requested that 
                            Chat use all of them, which it did. Although, I am unsure if the solution it found was as intended.
                            Although we cannot see the graphs in the chared chat, it seemed that instead of analyzing 
                            all the products together as a group to get very general, but possibily inconclusive, results,
                            Chat did the same analysis on all 10 products. This is essentially the same as 
                            doing the analysis on one product, but reporting it 10 times. Although this is still good data,
                            it may not have been the intention of the user. The final category, DI, is the most questionable one to me.
                            To identify when a discount was active, Chat took the mean price and claimed that any transactions happening
                            below the average were discount transactions. This method is very dubious as the average 
                            should be significantly lower than the true price since many discounts bring down the average price.
                            This could be the cause of the questionable results Chat gives at the end, where we ask it
                            to predict the increase in quantity sold when we apply a 10% discount. If there were enough discounts
                            provided, the average could be low enough that we do not have enough data identified as discounted to have good 
                            extrapolation. Sales data is likely very noisy, as many confounders play a role in when and how much people buy.
                            As such, if we do not have enough good data, we cannot reasonably extrapolate good results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although ChatGPT can be useful for coming up with potential ideas and doing quick analysis,
                            since it does not fully understand what it is doing it may make bad assumptions that weaken the analysis. 
                            In this case, using the average as the base price seems to be a bad assumption which results in odd results
                            coming from our analysis. It is important to pay attention to what assumptions are made and ensure they are all
                            good for a given application.

                        <h2>Prompt 2 - Company Funding</h2>
                        <p>
                            For this prompt, we gave ChatGPT some retail and investment data. We wanted to use this data to come up with
                            a funding strategy for our company. Although ChatGPT did well to reach the files which were stored in a Zip file,
                            it had trouble moving forward from this point. I believe that this is likely due to the vague definition of funding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let us look a little deeper at what ChatGPT did for us. Once ChatGPT had found the investment file and 
                            confirmed that was what we wanted to analyze, it started to give us information about the file. This is where 
                            I can see the first weakness fo ChatGPT. It seems that it often resorts to looking at one file at a time. 
                            Instead, it might be a good idea to look out all of the files together to have information on both the market and our
                            specific company to find a good approach. This limitation is likely due to how much ChatGPT can "remember". Keeping 
                            track of multiple files could become difficult for ChatGPT if it starts to forget thing too quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since ChatGPT only went ot the investment files, it made false assumptions about our goals. 
                            Since the Investment files gives a wide range of market data, ChatGPT wanted to analyze the 
                            data to understand things like "Which industries recieve the most funding?", "What are the most common funidng rounds?" or "Which types of investments are most common?". 
                            Although all of these things have a place in the conversation, they do not really answer how to get funding for our company. Since it 
                            seems we already have an idea for our company, understanding what industries recieve the most funding seems pointless since we would not suddenly switch fields.
                            Understanding funding rounds may help us decide smaller details, but does not give us a good strategy on how to approach organizing anything.
                            All the questions ChatGPT asked felt close to but not exactly what we wanted. It answered the questions it could see instead of the questions we were asking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the analysis ChatGPT did after giving us options seemed to give some insight, which would be helpful
                            if decided what field to go into or just give small insights, it did not really help solve the problem of getting funding.
                            ChatGPT did not really have the capacity to say "this data is not enough" or to use multiple data sources to get the right answers.
                            This makes sense as ChatGPT is not using real critical thinking but just very advanced pattern matching.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Prompt 3 - Fantasy Football</h2>
                        <p>
                            For this final prompt, we wanted chat GPT to take data from reddit post and use it to make the ideal fantasy football team.
                            It did well in initially recognizing the drawbacks of reddit-based data. However, it does have limitations that it tries to get around.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A major limitation with this analysis is the relevance of the data set. The process ChatGPT used to figure out good players is a sentiment 
                            analysis, where those with high sentiment values have a higher value. This implies that those people that are liked by the most people should be the
                            best. However, this is not necessarily true. Although the best players are generally the most popular, 
                            they are also the most polarizing. Those that love Messi could hate Ronaldo and vice versa due to the rivalry. The same
                            holds in football, where fans of one team might love their best player but other fans would hate that person for their skill,
                            using negative words to describe them. Since ChatGPT cannot recognize this nauance, it cannot correct for it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this is a more minor issue when compared to the larger issue of only using one name to describe players.
                            Even if this analysis was perfect and all the predictions were accurate, there is no way for one to extract 
                            useful information out of this since only one name. Although one could assume they would be the most popular name associated on google, 
                            this removes the impact of the data analysis by reducing the fidelity. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, ChatGPT does well to recognize that this analysis does not take into account 
                            important fcctors like position, role, form, price, and others among its analysis. It also recognizes
                            that sentiment analysis may not be directly linked to skill or points, but could be helpful.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the end, we see that ChatGPT has its limits. Since ChatGPT is just pattern matching to the extreme,
                            it does not have the logic humans do when it comes to picking the right assumptions, synthesizing the proper data, 
                            or answering the relevant questions. Although ChatGPT gave a good start to most of these questions and 
                            sometimes provided some useful analysis, we can see that it is not perfect. It is most definitely not ready to 
                            take over every job just yet.
